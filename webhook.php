/**
 * Receives Mercado Pago subscription webhooks.
 *
 * Authenticates, persists, returns 200. Nothing else. No lookup of the local
 * subscription row happens here, no state changes, no decision about whether
 * this notification matters — that is entirely the job of the (not yet
 * written) processing task that sweeps enrol_mercadopagosub_event on its own
 * schedule. Every design conclusion this split rests on is measured, not
 * assumed — see HANDOVER.md, "This settles webhook.php's handling,
 * definitively":
 *
 *   - subscription_preapproval is the only notification type whose data.id is
 *     directly usable (it is the preapproval id this plugin already stores).
 *   - payment and subscription_authorized_payment carry no id this plugin can
 *     search on without already knowing the preapproval id they belong to.
 *   - external_reference is absent from every notification body, of all three
 *     types, without exception. A GET is always required afterwards.
 *   - version is not a reliable ordering signal; gaps were observed with no
 *     corresponding loss of information.
 *
 * None of that reasoning needs to run here. It belongs to the processing task,
 * which reads the queue this file writes to and does the actual GET calls.
 * This file's only job is to not lose a delivery and to always answer 200, so
 * Mercado Pago never has reason to retry because of anything on this end.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT using ABORT_AFTER_CONFIG. A sibling plugin
 * (enrol_mercadopagocpro) shipped exactly that mistake: defining the constant
 * at all aborts setup regardless of its value, which is not what "defined it
 * as false" was meant to do. Rather than repeat that defect, or introduce a
 * new one by relying on autoloading and get_config() being available in a
 * bootstrap mode this project has not measured, this file takes the full,
 * ordinary Moodle bootstrap and pays whatever overhead that costs. Class files
 * this endpoint needs are also require_once'd directly by path below, rather
 * than trusted to autoload, so correctness here does not depend on how much of
 * setup.php actually ran.
