/**
 * Sweeps every locally active subscription against Mercado Pago on its own
 * fixed schedule, independent of any webhook having arrived.
 *
 * This is the design point event_processor's own docblock defers to: a
 * `payment` or `subscription_authorized_payment` notification is marked
 * processed and does nothing else, because neither carries an id this plugin
 * can search on directly, and — the reasoning recorded here for review, not
 * previously frozen — webhooks are demonstrably unreliable as a trigger signal
 * anyway (measured `version` gaps mean some deliveries never arrive at all).
 * A subscription this plugin has not heard from in a while must still be
 * checked; that is what this class is for.
 *
 * Two things happen for each subscription swept, in this order:
 *
 *   1. Every authorized payment Mercado Pago reports is recorded in
 *      enrol_mercadopagosub_payment, keyed by mppaymentid so a repeat sweep
 *      updates rather than duplicates.
 *   2. The subscription itself is re-fetched and synced through
 *      event_processor::sync_from_response() — the same method a webhook-driven
 *      update uses — so enrolment and group membership stay correct regardless
 *      of which path noticed the change first.
 *
 * Overdue detection follows from what is left after both of those: if the
 * subscription's own next_payment_date has passed and no successful payment
 * covers it, Mercado Pago's own subscription object gives no signal of this on
 * its own — `status` measured so far stays `authorized` regardless
 * (API-FINDINGS.md's `retry_attempt`/`next_retry_date` live on the *payment*
 * record, not the subscription). This class is therefore the only place that
 * can ever set local `state = 'overdue'`.
