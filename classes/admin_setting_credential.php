/**
 * A masked credential field that forgets the cached collecting account when saved.
 *
 * collector::load() caches the account identity for up to a day, keyed on nothing
 * about the credentials themselves — it assumes whatever is configured now is what
 * was configured when the cache was written. That assumption breaks the moment an
 * administrator changes the access token: the cached currency, country and
 * test-account flag would keep answering for the old account until the cache aged
 * out on its own, silently, for up to 24 hours.
 *
 * Extending admin_setting_configpasswordunmask and overriding write_setting() is
 * the standard way to attach a side effect to saving one admin setting; the parent
 * write is always attempted first; the cache is only forgotten once it succeeds.
