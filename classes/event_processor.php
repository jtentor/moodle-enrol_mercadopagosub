/**
 * Does the work webhook.php deliberately does not.
 *
 * Reads enrol_mercadopagosub_event rows with processstatus = 'queued' and acts
 * on them. The payload column is never read as data here — its own schema
 * comment says so ("Treated as a signal, never as a source of truth") — every
 * business fact this class acts on comes from a fresh API call, keyed only by
 * the resource id the notification pointed at.
 *
 * This is also why acting on an event is safe regardless of signaturestatus.
 * A forged notification can, at worst, make this class re-fetch and re-sync
 * one of this site's own subscriptions sooner than its next scheduled check —
 * it cannot make this class believe anything the platform itself did not just
 * say, because nothing here is ever read from the notification body. This
 * reasoning is this session's judgement call, not a prior measurement; it is
 * recorded in HANDOVER.md for review rather than applied silently.
