/**
 * The one thing this plugin needs from an HTTP mechanism.
 *
 * This plugin ships with curl_transport and no vendored SDK. Mercado Pago's own
 * documentation for the Subscriptions API is written in curl, the design of this
 * plugin was verified against the live API with curl, and the surface in use is
 * four endpoints. Adding an SDK would add several hundred files to audit and keep
 * byte-identical, for no capability the plugin exercises.
 *
 * The interface exists so that decision stays reversible. Replacing the mechanism
 * means writing one class that implements this interface and passing it to
 * api_client; nothing else in the plugin refers to curl, to HTTP headers, or to
 * request encoding. In particular, api_client owns the endpoint paths, the request
 * bodies and the interpretation of failures — a transport only moves bytes.
 *
 * An implementation must not throw on an HTTP error status. A 400 is a completed
 * exchange and is reported through http_response::$status, because the platform's
 * error body is the only diagnostic it provides and discarding it has, in a sibling
 * plugin, cost real debugging time. Reserve $transporterror for exchanges that
 * never completed at all.
