/**
 * Verifies the x-signature header Mercado Pago sends on every notification.
 *
 * The manifest format below was deliberately left unverified in earlier
 * sessions of this project — HANDOVER.md said so explicitly, rather than
 * writing this from memory. It is now confirmed against Mercado Pago's own
 * developer documentation (mercadopago.com/developers/.../notifications/webhooks)
 * and cross-checked against three independent third-party implementations
 * (a Mercado Pago SDK maintainer's own forum answer, and two unrelated
 * integration write-ups), all agreeing on the same construction:
 *
 *   manifest = "id:{data.id};request-id:{x-request-id};ts:{ts};"
 *   expected = hex(HMAC-SHA256(manifest, webhook_secret))
 *   valid    = expected === v1
 *
 * ts and v1 arrive together in one header, x-signature, as
 * "ts=<epoch>,v1=<hex>" — measured directly against this plugin's own capture
 * log, matching what the documentation shows.
 *
 * data.id is specified as coming from the notification URL's query string, not
 * the JSON body. In every capture this plugin has taken so far the two values
 * were identical, but the caller should still prefer the query string value —
 * see webhook.php, which extracts it directly rather than through PHP's
 * superglobals, because PHP silently rewrites a "data.id" query key to
 * "data_id" in $_GET.
