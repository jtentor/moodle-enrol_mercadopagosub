/**
 * Who this site collects money as.
 *
 * Mercado Pago accounts belong to a marketplace site, and a site settles in one
 * currency. That single fact governs three things this plugin would otherwise
 * have to guess at:
 *
 *   - which currency an instance may charge in;
 *   - which country a subscriber's own account has to be registered in, because
 *     an account from another site is refused at creation with guest_site_mismatch;
 *   - whether the credentials in use belong to a test account, which creates
 *     subscriptions no real buyer can ever pay.
 *
 * None of it is configuration. It is a property of the credentials, so it is read
 * from the platform rather than typed in by an administrator who may be wrong.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a country whitelist. Hardcoding a list of supported
 * countries is what has pushed other integrations into shipping a separate plugin
 * per country, and it goes stale every time the platform opens a new market. A
 * site whose account settles in a currency this class does not recognise still
 * works: the administrator sets the currency explicitly and the plugin gets out
 * of the way.
 *
 * The account endpoint returns a large record carrying the account holder's email
 * address, national identification number, postal address and telephone. None of
 * that is needed here, so nothing beyond the five fields below is ever cached or
 * held in memory: the response is reduced as soon as it arrives.
