/**
 * Acts on the core enrolment period ending, per the expiredaction setting.
 *
 * Another thin wrapper, for the same reason as send_expiry_notifications: the
 * real logic — unenrolling, suspending, or suspending-without-roles per
 * ENROL_EXT_REMOVED_* — lives in enrol_plugin::process_expirations() already.
 * Registering this task is what makes the expiredaction setting in
 * settings.php do anything at all; without it, the setting sits in the admin
 * UI exactly as inert as it was in enrol_self before MDL-66786 was raised.
