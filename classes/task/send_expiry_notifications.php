/**
 * Sends warnings ahead of the core enrolment period ending.
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper: enrol_plugin::send_expiry_notifications() already
 * contains the real logic — reading the per-instance expirynotify setting, the
 * site's expirynotifyhour, and the four expirymessage* strings this plugin
 * defines. Nothing here decides anything; the task exists only so that method
 * gets called on a schedule at all.
 *
 * This concerns the core enrolment period (enrolstartdate/enrolenddate), which
 * is independent of the subscription's own status machine
 * (pending/trialing/active/overdue/ended) driven by Mercado Pago's webhooks.
 * A subscriber whose card keeps charging successfully every cycle may still see
 * this warning if the instance was also given a fixed enrolment end date.
