/**
 * Creates a plan-less Mercado Pago subscription for one enrolment instance.
 *
 * The request body follows API-FINDINGS.md §5 and the shape probe.php measured
 * as working (baseline_body()): reason, external_reference, payer_email,
 * auto_recurring (frequency, frequency_type, transaction_amount, currency_id,
 * and free_trial when the instance has a trial), back_url, status "pending".
 * notification_url is deliberately not sent — API-FINDINGS.md §1 measured it as
 * accepted and silently discarded; the real notification URL is configured once,
 * by hand, in Your integrations.
 *
 * Everything this plugin will later need to identify the subscription again
 * comes from what this class does here: external_reference is minted by
 * util::make_reference() before the call, so the local row and the API request
 * agree on it before either exists at the platform, and preapprovalid is read
 * back from the response, never guessed.
