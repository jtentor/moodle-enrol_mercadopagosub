 * Message providers for enrol_mercadopagosub.

 * One provider, matching what enrol_plugin::send_expiry_notifications() sends
 * through the message API. The identifier 'expiry_notification' is not
 * arbitrary — it mirrors enrol_self's and enrol_manual's own provider name for
 * the same core method, which is the convention core itself expects.
