/**
 * Capabilities for the Mercado Pago Subscriptions enrolment plugin.
 *
 * These archetypes depart from enrol_self on purpose. enrol_self grants :config
 * and :manage to editingteacher, which is right for a method that costs nobody
 * anything. This method sets a price, binds a recurring charge to a real payment
 * account and can stop one, so the defaults keep it with manager and away from the
 * teaching role.
 *
 * That is a default, not a policy. A site that wants a dedicated administrative
 * role — which is the arrangement this plugin's documentation recommends — grants
 * these capabilities to it and leaves the teacher archetype alone. A site that
 * genuinely wants teachers pricing their own courses grants :config to
 * editingteacher and gets the enrol_self behaviour back. What the defaults avoid
 * is a site acquiring the ability to charge money without anyone deciding to.
 *
 * Note that the course welcome message is deliberately not covered here: its form
 * field is gated on :config or moodle/course:editcoursewelcomemessage, so a
 * teacher who cannot configure the method can still write what its subscribers
 * are told.
