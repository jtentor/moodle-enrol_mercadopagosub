/**
 * Scheduled tasks for enrol_mercadopagosub.
 *
 * process_events and reconcile_payments are thin wrappers over this plugin's
 * own classes (event_processor, payment_reconciler) rather than core methods —
 * see those classes for the actual logic and the reasoning behind it. The
 * other two wrap core enrol_plugin methods — see the class-level documentation
 * in classes/task/ for why neither implements its own logic.
 *
 * reconcile_payments is the task that finally closes the gap left open when
 * process_events was written: it is the only place that ever writes
 * enrol_mercadopagosub_payment, and the only place that can ever set local
 * state = 'overdue'. It runs on its own fixed schedule, not triggered by any
 * specific webhook — see payment_reconciler's own docblock for why.
