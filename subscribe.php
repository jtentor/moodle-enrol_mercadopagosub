/**
 * Collects the payer's Mercado Pago address and starts a subscription.
 *
 * enrol_page_hook() links here for anyone can_subscribe() allows. That method
 * is the single authority on whether this page should do anything at all, so
 * this file re-checks it rather than trusting that the link it followed was
 * only ever shown to someone entitled to use it — the URL is guessable.
 *
 * NOT YET FUNCTIONAL PAST FORM SUBMISSION: the call to subscription_service
 * below is written against an interface that does not exist yet (HANDOVER.md,
 * "Next iteration", item 5). Submitting this form fatals with a class-not-found
 * error until that class is written. This mirrors, deliberately, the same
 * incremental approach already taken with enrol_page_hook()'s link to this very
 * file before it existed: the contract is written first, the implementation
 * catches up next.
